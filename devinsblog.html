to my blog, I love South Park , Archer, and all those funny adult animated shows!</p>
               <p>South Park is by far one of my favorite shows to watch!!</p>

               	<p> Archer is another favorite show of mine staring a It follows the exploits of a dysfunctional group of secret agents Sterling Archer and seven of his colleagues Malory Archer, Lana Kane, Cheryl Tunt, Pam Poovey, Ray Gillette, Cyril Figgis, and Dr. Algernop Krieger.</p>
               	<p> Archer and Krieger are by far the most funniest charaters in the show Archer is a disgusting Alcoholic with mother issuses and the other is a crazy scientist and the clone Adolf Hitler</p>

               	<p> Sick, twisted and politically incorrect, the animated series features the adventures of the Griffin family. Endearingly ignorant Peter and his stay-at-home wife Lois reside in Quahog, R.I., and have three kids. Meg, the eldest child, is a social outcast, and teenage Chris is awkward and clueless when it comes to the opposite sex. The youngest, Stewie, is a genius baby bent on killing his mother and destroying the world. The talking dog, Brian, keeps Stewie in check while sipping martinis and sorting through his own life issues.</p>
               	<p> Peter, Stewie, and Brain are mt favorite character in show each of them are funny in their own way</p>
               </div>

               	<p> Actor Seth Green ("Family Guy") and Matthew Senreich created the off-the-wall comedy hit, which is a series of pop-culture parodies using stop-motion animation of toys, action figures and dolls. The title character was an ordinary chicken until he was run down by a car and subsequently brought back to life in cyborg form by mad scientist Fritz Huhnmorder, who tortures Robot Chicken by forcing him to watch a random selection of TV shows, the sketches that make up the body of each episode. The show often features special episodes built around a single theme, including "Star Wars" and DC Comics.</p>
               	<p> This show is also funny with it sketches espically with it's superheroes</p>

               	<p> Aging superhero Titanium Rex has long headed the League of Freedom, a once-proud group of heroes that is on the decline due to an influx of heroes from the millennial generation who have little interest in fighting crime. Rex ends up mentoring the young warriors in the SuperMansion, where they live together, as they try to learn to fight for justice, liberty and the need to stay relevant to society.</p>
               	<p> Black Saturn is my favorite character of the show espically bieng a spoof of Batman and team screw up</p>
